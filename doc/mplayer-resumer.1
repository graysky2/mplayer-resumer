.SH DESCRIPTION
Watching 90 % of a video and stopping causes you to return to the beginning again the next time you watch it. Remembering where you were in the video and resuming at that position is a much nicer behavior for the user. By default, \fImplayer\fP spits out timecode information that tells you where you are in the video, to the tenth of a second. Mplayer also supports a seek feature on the command-line. We can make use of these features to write an \fImplayer\fP wrapper that will remember the last position in a video file and resume to it on playback.
.PP
Note that restarted within 5 seconds, this script will delete the tracking file thus resetting the resume position to the beginning of the file.

.SH BUGS
If the video file to be played is on a read-only file system, or otherwise lives in a location that cannot be written to, resume will fail. This is because the current implementation uses a file parallel to the video file to store the timecode.
